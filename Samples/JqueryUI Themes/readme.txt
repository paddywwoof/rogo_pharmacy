This folder contains a few jQueryUI themes which have been downloaded from 'http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/'. To use a theme from this folder, copy the theme folder and its contents to your 'External Assets Files' folder and rename the theme folder to 'jQueryUI', for example 'jqueryui (sunny)' is renamed to 'jQueryUI'. Then within the Knowledge Builder development environment change the Deploy Settings to use your 'External Assets Files' folder, it should then pick up the theme and indicate this with a message, 'jQuery UI theme folder detected in assets!'.
